## **Vetted Backend**
This repo contains the codebase for the backend of the Vetted chrome extension which can be installed from here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vetted-launcher/fhonhdflkbgigofpohogckdeebpgjjcf?authuser=0&hl=en-GB
I originally built this application to improve my Python programming skills. I obtained mentorship through the data science bootcamp program **[SharpestMinds](https://www.sharpestminds.com/)**
